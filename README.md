# RoverControlsSystem

To Run:
  - open pycharm
  - open both the server and client code
  - connect ps4 controller
  - run the server code
  - run the client code
  - make sure you are seeing the output from the server code run tab
  - test the mapped controls and the output values

For the camera task, I managed to test out the openCV library and GStreamer pipeline. The camera code should run if the opencv library is installed in your pycharm project. Thank you! :D
